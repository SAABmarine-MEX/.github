## Deep Reinforcement Learning and Residual Dynamic Modelling for BlueROV2

The work from this project can be divded into four main parts:

WIP:

* ROS2
  * ROS2 based Ground Control Station (GCS) using Mavros for the BlueROV2
  * Repo: [saabmarineMEX_ros2](https://github.com/SAABmarine-MEX/saabmarineMEX_ros2)
* Simulation
  * BlueROV2 Unity-based simulation in SMaRCSim
  * Repos: [SMARCUnityStandardRL](https://github.com/SAABmarine-MEX/SMARCUnityStandardRL), [SMARCUnityAssetsRL](https://github.com/SAABmarine-MEX/SMARCUnityAssetsRL) (both required, check respective readme for installation guide) 
* Residual Dynamic Modelling
  * Training and inference pipeline for enhancing the realism of simulated BlueROV2 dynamics
  * Repo: [DRL-Python](https://github.com/SAABmarine-MEX/DRL-Python)
* Deep Reinforcement Learning
  * Training and ROS2 inference pipeline for Deep Rienforcement Learning (DRL) control policy of BlueROV2
  * Repos:
    * Training: [DRL-Python](https://github.com/SAABmarine-MEX/DRL-Python)
    * Inference: [saabmarineMEX_ros2](https://github.com/SAABmarine-MEX/saabmarineMEX_ros2)
